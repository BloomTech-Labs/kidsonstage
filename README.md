# Kids On Stage

Kids on Stage is an application for event administrators such as cheerleading competitions, track meets, and recitals.
The administrators can purchase an event queue, and the parents can sign up for an account. The users can then enter their
phone number and/or email address into the queue system. The admin can then choose to notify the parents of a group or individual
that they are "on deck" or "next to be on deck" for whatever event is taking place. This should provide some fluidity to the event.
